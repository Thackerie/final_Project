# WalletWise 
    #### Video Demo:  
    #### Description:

    My final project is a budgeting app. It lets the user create, manage, display and delete balances, incomes and expenses to track their funds over time. 

    #### Distinctiveness and Complexity:
    This project is unique, because its about budgeting, which was not one of the topics covered by any of the previous projects. 
    The users are not interacting with each other but are only interacting with the website, unlike in the commerce, mail and network projects. 
    
    The project is complex because of the level of sophistication of its underlying database and routing. There are five different models, all constantly working together to result in the simplified tracking of budgets for the user. There are 23 Views in the main views file, there are another 13 in a separate viewsHelpers file and there is a total of 23 urls on the app.  

    #### Files:

    #### How to run:
    There are no additional pythin packages that need to be installed for this app to work, so startig it is just like any other django app. Once you have started the application, you will be prompted to login or signup. Since you dont alrady have an account, you will sign up. Once youre signed up and logged in, you will get prompted to create your first dashboard
